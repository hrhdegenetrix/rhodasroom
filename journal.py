Angel of God, my guardian dear
To whom God's love commits me here.
Ever this night be at my side,
To light and guard, to rule and guide.
Amen.
//Hail Mary (Ave Maria):
Hail, Mary, full of grace!
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,
And Blessed is the Fruit of Thy Womb,

Jesus.
[I raise my head again ]
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
Pray for us sinners now,
And at the hour of our death.
Amen.
//St Michael Prayer
St Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle;
Be our protection against the wickedness and the snares of the devil.
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray;
And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host,
By the powers of God,
Cast into Hell satan
And all the evil spirits
Who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.
//Glory Be (Maggie offers this exclusively for the Glory of the Trinity)
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning,
Is now,
And ever shall be,
World without end.
Amen.
//The Lord's Prayer:
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.
//Prayer for the Faithful Departed
Eternal rest, grant unto them, O Lord,
And may perpetual light shine upon them.
May all the souls of the faithfully departed,
Through the mercy of God,
Rest in peace.
Amen.
